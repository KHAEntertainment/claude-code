# Context Management Initiative

## Overview
This directory contains planning and documentation for fine-tuning Claude-Code to eliminate context window waste from system prompts, agent descriptions, and tool specifications.

## The Problem
Claude-Code currently consumes **40-60k tokens** at idle - that's 20-30% of the context window before any actual coding begins.

## The Solution
Fine-tune models with system knowledge embedded in weights, achieving:
- 🚀 **0 tokens** of system overhead
- 📈 **40% more** usable context for projects
- ⚡ **30-50% faster** responses
- 💰 **25-40% lower** API costs

## Files

### 📋 [EXECUTION-PLAN.md](./EXECUTION-PLAN.md)
Quick-start guide for implementing fine-tuning:
- Fork structure setup
- Step-by-step implementation
- Testing phases and timelines
- Migration to hive installer

### 📚 [CONTEXT-MANAGEMENT-STRATEGY.md](./CONTEXT-MANAGEMENT-STRATEGY.md)
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Problem analysis and vision
- Technical approach and methodology
- Training data generation strategies
- Tools, frameworks, and future directions

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up fine-tuning environment
mkdir -p fine-tuning/{extract,generate,datasets,models,scripts}

# 2. Extract system knowledge
python fine-tuning/extract/extract_knowledge.py

# 3. Generate test dataset (100 examples)
python fine-tuning/generate/generate_dataset.py --count 100

# 4. Fine-tune GPT-3.5 for proof of concept
python fine-tuning/scripts/finetune.py --model gpt-3.5-turbo

# 5. Test and validate
CLAUDE_CODE_MODE=finetuned pytest tests/fine-tuning/
```

## Current Status
🔬 **Experimentation Phase** - Testing feasibility of embedding system knowledge into model weights

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Create fork and documentation
2. 🔄 Extract current system prompts and rules
3. ⏳ Generate initial training dataset
4. ⏳ Run proof-of-concept fine-tuning
5. ⏳ Validate behavior preservation

## Contributing
This is an experimental initiative. Ideas, code, and testing welcome!
